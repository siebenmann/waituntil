/*
Waituntil is a command that waits (sleeps) until some specific time,
or technically until it is that time or later. It makes some attempt
to deal with the system time shifting out from underneath it, but it
doesn't try too hard here.

usage: waituntil [-v] <WHEN>

-v reports the target time waituntil will (try to) wait for.

<WHEN> has two forms. The simple form is HH:MM[:SS], with HH in 24
hour time. If HH:MM is in the past, waituntil assumes that you mean
that time tomorrow.

The full form is YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM[:SS]. You can omit YYYY and MM to
mean the current year and month, and you can omit the time of day (in
which case it's taken as midnight).  If this time is in the past,
waituntil exits immediately.
