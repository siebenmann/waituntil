waituntil is a simple (Unix) utility to sleep until a specific time is
reached (as opposed to the sleep command, which waits for a specific
duration).

usage:	waituntil [-v] <WHEN>

<WHEN> may be:		HH:MM[:SS]
			[[YYYY-]MM-]DD [HH:MM[:SS]]

In the first form, a time in the past of today is taken to be that
time tomorrow.
